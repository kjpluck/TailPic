TailPic
=======

Displays an image and automatically refreshes on change

*But, why?*

If you're using a tool or written a script that generates images and you want to check that the output is cool that set TailPic to watch it without having to load it into an image viewer all the time.

*Usage*

When executed a file dialog pops up, select an image file to watch. Any updates to the image will show. Simple :-)
